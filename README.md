# ðŸ‘· GermanPostcodes ðŸš§(WIP)

This is simple first implementation I needed for my projects.
If this would be helpfull for you, feel free to fork and contribute or ask.

This module should help to find relevant data such as state for a givven postcode. 
The data comes from [github.com/zauberware/postal-codes-json-xml-csv](https://github.com/zauberware/postal-codes-json-xml-csv) and therfore from [geonames.org](https://www.geonames.org/).
